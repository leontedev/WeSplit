#100DaysOfSwiftUI - Project 1 - Days 16-18 - [[https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/16][www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/16]]

** Day 16
 - Text { } view
 - Form { } view
 - Max 10 childs per parent (across all of SwiftUI). Use Group { } views to add more.
 - Section { } view
 - Navigation bar: NavigationView { }
 - Modifiers, eg: .navigationBarTitle("SwiftUI") on NavigationView which defaults to a large title. For a small title .navigationBarTitle(Text("SwiftUI"), displayMode: .inline)
 - "In SwiftUI the UI is a function of the state"
 - @State property wrapper
 - TextField { } view
 - Binding state to UI controls (two-way binding): $name
 - ForEach loop can create more than 10 child views per parent:
#+BEGIN_SRC Swift
// Because it takes a closure - you can reffer to the iteration number simply as $0
ForEach(0 ..< 100) { number in
  Text("Row \(number)")
}
#+END_SRC
 - Picker { } view
#+BEGIN_SRC Swift
struct ContentView: View {
    let students = ["Harry", "Hermione", "Ron"]
    @State private var selectedStudent = "Harry"

    var body: some View {
        Picker("Select your student", selection: $selectedStudent) {
            ForEach(0 ..< students.count) {
                Text(self.students[$0])
            }
        }
    }
}
#+END_SRC
